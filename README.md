# PHP Recursive Function Unexpected Data Type Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving unexpected data type handling within a recursive function that processes nested arrays.  The function attempts to handle various data types but lacks robust error handling for unforeseen scenarios.

## The Bug

The `processData` function recursively processes a nested array, converting numeric strings to integers, and handling strings directly. However, it currently does not effectively manage cases where unexpected data types (e.g., boolean, null) are encountered in the input array.

## Solution

The solution improves the function to gracefully handle unexpected data types using `is_numeric()` for more precise type checking and by adding a `try-catch` block for potential errors. The solution also includes logging to track the errors which adds a layer of diagnostics to aid future debugging and maintenance.
